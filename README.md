## TL;DR

You tell it a BookMyShow link and a date. It polls the site, and the moment that
date is bookable you get one DM. Say `date:any` instead and it pings you every
time a *new* date unlocks or a *new* cinema starts showing the movie. Trim the
noise with filters: `format:IMAX,4DX` only pings for those screens,
`theatre:PVR,INOX` only for those cinemas, and `days:fri,sat` only on those
weekdays. (`format:` filters date and showtime alerts; "new cinema appeared"
alerts are not format-filtered, but they *are* theatre-filtered — see
[Commands](#commands).)

Works for movies, concerts, plays, any event BookMyShow lists in India.

It observes and notifies. It never buys tickets, holds seats, or fills carts.

## 🎯 Features

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 📅 **Watch one date** | One DM the moment that date opens. The watch then deletes itself. No spam. |
| 🎬 **Subscribe to a movie** | `date:any` = a DM every time a new date unlocks or a new cinema appears. |
| 🎥 **Format, theatre + day filters** | Only ping for what you care about: `format:IMAX,4DX` matches by name (ScreenX spelling is flexible, e.g. `SCREENX` or `SCREEN X`), `theatre:PVR,INOX` by cinema name or venue code, `days:fri,sat` by weekday. All three filter date and showtime alerts; new-cinema alerts are theatre-filtered but not format-filtered. |
| ✅ **Validates at creation** | The link is checked against the live site when you save it, so a broken watch fails immediately, not silently. |
| ⚡ **One request per movie** | 50 watches on the same movie cost the same as 1. Coalesced polling keeps BookMyShow happy. |
| 📱 **User-install commands** | Works in DMs and servers, installs straight to your account. |
| 💾 **SQLite, zero config** | No database server, no Docker required. One file. |

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick start

One command on Linux or macOS. It installs Bun, clones the repo, prompts for
your Discord credentials, registers the slash commands, and starts the bot under
pm2:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ishannaik/seatsniper/main/install.sh | bash
```

> `install.sh` supports Linux and macOS. On Windows, use the Manual setup or
> Docker instructions below. A datacenter VPS in India can work with Safari TLS
> to BookMyShow, while a residential home IP is optional, not required. See the
> [measured findings](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-bms-access-findings.md).

Non-interactive, for CI or a box with no terminal:

```bash
DISCORD_TOKEN=... DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=... bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ishannaik/seatsniper/main/install.sh)
```

Then:

1. Invite the bot with the URL the installer prints.
2. In Discord, run `/watch` and paste a BookMyShow link.
3. Wait. The DM arrives when tickets go live.

<a id="run-with-docker"></a>

## 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ishannaik/seatsniper.git && cd seatsniper
cp .env.example .env                  # fill in DISCORD_TOKEN and DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
docker compose run --rm seatsniper bun run commands   # register slash commands
docker compose up -d
```

The database lives in a named volume, so the bot survives container restarts.

There is no HTTP healthcheck. `docker compose ps` showing "up" only means the
process is running, not that the bot is logged in and polling. Configure
`UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL`; the bot pings it after each poll, so a missing push
means polling stopped even if the container is still up.

## 📦 Manual setup

```bash
bun install               # installs via bun.sh
cp .env.example .env      # DISCORD_TOKEN, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
bun run commands          # register slash commands
bun run start             # or: bun run dev for watch mode
```

```bash
pm2 start "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun" --name seatsniper --interpreter none --time -- run src/index.ts
pm2 save
```

Bun auto-loads `.env` from the working directory.

## 🎮 Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/watch link:<url> date:YYYY-MM-DD` | DM once when that date opens, then delete the watch |
| `/watch link:<url> date:any` | Subscribe. DM when a new date or cinema appears |
| `/watch link:<url> format:IMAX,4DX theatre:PVR,INOX days:fri,sat after:18:00 before:23:00` | Optional filters on any watch. Ping only for these formats, cinemas, weekdays, or start times. `after:`/`before:` are IST wall clock, 24-hour (`18:00`) or 12-hour (`6:00 PM`); `before:` is exclusive and the window cannot wrap past midnight |
| `/list` | Show your active watches |
| `/stop id:<n>` | Stop watch `n` from `/list` |
| `/help` | How the bot works |

> **What `format:` does and does not cover.** A subscription (`date:any`) can alert
> on two different things: a **new date** opening, and a **new cinema** starting to
> list the film. `format:` is enforced on the new-date half — the bot re-fetches
> showtimes for each fresh date and drops the ones with no matching show. It is
> **not** enforced on the new-cinema half: fresh venues are detected by venue code
> alone, so a new cinema listing the film in any format still produces a DM. The
> filter line on that DM reflects the filters you set, not a format that was checked
> for the cinema. `days:` behaves the same way — it applies to dates, and a cinema is
> not a date.
>
> **`theatre:` is the exception** — it *is* enforced on the new-cinema half. A fresh
> venue already carries its name and code from the same response the diff is computed
> from, so filtering it costs no extra request and needs none of the coalescing the
> format check does. `theatre:PVR` therefore stays silent when an INOX starts listing
> the film. It matches case-insensitively as a substring of the cinema name *or* its
> venue code, so `theatre:PVR` catches "PVR: Phoenix Palladium" and `theatre:IMOB`
> works if you'd rather paste a code.

Each user can hold up to 5 watches.

<a id="how-it-works"></a>

## 🧠 How it works

1. **Save.** `/watch` parses the link, then hits BookMyShow once to confirm the
   movie exists. Bad links fail here, not days later.
2. **Poll.** Every `POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 600 s) the bot checks each
   watch. Watches on the same movie share one request.
3. **Detect.** Availability comes from the `showDateCode` on each show.
   BookMyShow silently serves the nearest bookable date when the one you asked
   for is closed, so the URL, the HTTP status, and the page header all lie. The
   per-show field does not.
4. **Notify.** A dated watch DMs you once, then removes itself. A subscription
   compares today's dates and cinemas against what it has seen before and DMs
   the difference.

Failure is never silence. A blocked or unparseable response throws and logs;
after 3 consecutive failures the bot tells you, so a dead poller cannot sit
quietly forever.

### Request coalescing

Within one poll cycle, the bot keeps a map keyed by movie (city + event).
`bookableDatesCached` returns the cached BookMyShow response when the same movie
is watched again, so 50 watches on one film cost roughly one request per cycle.
`beginCycle()` clears that map at the start of every poll so an answer is never
served across cycles.

Format filters are intentionally the exception for subscription watches: each
fresh date requires an additional showtimes request. Dated watches already have
their showtimes and apply the format filter in memory. This is a deliberate
tradeoff, not a bug.

Coalescing reduces request volume on whatever egress you run. It is not a
substitute for suitable egress: BookMyShow checks the TLS fingerprint, and
its geographic restrictions can still block datacenter IPs outside India.

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | yes | | Bot token from the Discord developer portal |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | yes | | Application ID from the same page |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` | no | | Register commands in one guild instantly instead of waiting ~1 h for global |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` | no | `600` | Seconds between poll cycles (recommend at least 120-300 for personal use) |
| `STAGGER_MS_MIN` | no | `2000` | Shortest pause between two watches inside one cycle |
| `STAGGER_MS_MAX` | no | `5000` | Longest pause between two watches inside one cycle |
| `DB_PATH` | no | `seatsniper.db` | SQLite file location |
| `UPTIME_KUMA_PUSH_URL` | no | | Uptime Kuma push URL; the bot pings it after each poll |
| `BMS_TLS_PROFILE` | no | `safari_ios_18_0` | `node-tls-client` profile for the BookMyShow session. Rotate only between **Safari/Firefox** profiles if Cloudflare starts blocking (see [BookMyShow quirks](#bookmyshow-quirks)). Chrome profiles are rejected, not merely discouraged. An unknown or unsupported name fails at startup. |

Keep `POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` at or above 120-300 seconds for personal use. Faster
polls do **not** require a residential IP; they increase request volume and
ban/rate-limit risk on any IP class. The default of 600 remains the safe
baseline.

`POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` spaces the cycles apart; the stagger spaces the watches
*inside* one cycle. Each watch is followed by a random pause drawn uniformly from
`[STAGGER_MS_MIN, STAGGER_MS_MAX)`. That is anti-burst insurance against looking
automated, so **setting both to `0` is allowed but discouraged** — it removes the only
thing spacing your requests out, at a rate-limit and bot-signature risk. Same point as
above: it is not a residential-IP question, since fingerprint and request shape matter
more than where the traffic comes from.

An unparseable or negative value is not fatal — the bot logs a `[config]` warning and
uses the default. A `STAGGER_MS_MAX` below `STAGGER_MS_MIN` is raised to the minimum,
giving a fixed delay, rather than being silently swapped.

## 🧗 BookMyShow quirks

- **Geo-fenced.** Datacenter IPs outside India can be blocked. A home server in
  India is the safest host. The bot speaks Safari's TLS fingerprint via
  `node-tls-client`, which passes BookMyShow's Cloudflare checks.
- **No heuristics.** Availability is a field comparison, not a scrape-and-guess.
  The measured findings behind this live in
  [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-bms-access-findings.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-bms-access-findings.md).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bun install` / TLS lib missing | Bun blocks trusted deps | `bun pm trust --all` |
| HTTP 403 from BookMyShow | Chrome profile, bare curl, or wrong headers | Use the Safari profile only; read the [measured findings](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-27-bms-access-findings.md) |
| "Need residential proxy?" | Prior-art myth | **No** for Safari TLS on a capable host; a measured Oracle datacenter works |
| Slash commands missing | Global vs guild registration | Set `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` for instant guild commands |
| DMs never arrive | User closed DMs | The bot falls back to a channel; open DMs with the bot |
| Integration tests fail in CI | Live BookMyShow from US runners | Keep `integration.ts` manual and not part of CI |

## ⚠️ Limitations & hosting

- **One shared hosted instance concentrates ban risk.** A single public bot is
  one IP ban away from going dark, and multi-tenant "forever free" bots are
  fragile.
- **SeatSniper is observe-only.** It never buys or holds tickets, by design.

When it will break: Cloudflare may harden the Safari handshake, an abused IP
can lose reputation even with a valid profile, and a BookMyShow HTML reshape
can surface as a `BmsError` or as silence until the parser is updated.
